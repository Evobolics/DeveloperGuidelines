# Abstract

This document contains a number of software development guides that are intended to aide developers in writing software.  Most of these guides are just guidelines, and should be treated as such; but when they are generally adhered to, they can save a lot of future time and effort.  I am always up for feedback so please feel free to drop me a line.
