# Abstract

This document contains a number of software development guides that are intended to aide developers in writing software.  Most of these guides are just guidelines, and should be treated as such; but when they are generally adhered to, they can save a lot of future time and effort.  I am always up for feedback so please feel free to drop me a line.

# General Rules of Thumb

## Treat Coding as a Business - Not as Research

Unless your organization is focused on research, at the end of the day, the goal is to create and deploy software that a business can use to produce a return on investment (ROI).  Therefore, when prioritizing time, it is more important stories get completed and things work well; creating beautiful code is always secondary.  While it is important to take pride in having well structured code, very few people in the business will ever see the code.  Most likely only other developers and IT professionals in the organization will ever work with it.  Thus, do spend time structuring code well but do not take so much time that it hurts the teams story velocity - **story velocity and code that works well without error is king**.  Remember, at any point in time, the business can choose to cancel a project or shift directions, regardless if it is a work of art or not, and all of the time perfecting a piece of code will be lost.
