# Software Development Guidelines Abstract

This document contains a number of software development guides that are intended to aide developers in writing software.  Most of these guides are just guidelines, and should be treated as such; but when they are generally adhered to, they can save a lot of future time and effort.  I am always up for feedback so please feel free to drop me a line.



# General Rules of Thumb

The following are rules that developers need to read and follow in addition to technical guidelines that will follow. 

## Treat Coding as a Business - Not as Research

Unless your organization is focused on research, at the end of the day, the goal is to create and deploy software that a business can use to produce a return on investment (ROI).  Therefore, when prioritizing time, it is more important stories get completed and things work well; creating beautiful code is always secondary.  While it is important to take pride in having well structured code, very few people in the business will ever see the code.  Most likely, only other developers and IT professionals in the organization will ever work with it.  Thus, do spend time structuring code well but do not take so much time that it hurts the teams story velocity - **story velocity and code that works well without error is king**.  Remember, at any point in time, the business can choose to cancel a project or shift directions, regardless if it is a work of art or not, and all of the time perfecting a piece of code will be lost.

## Same Office Attendance Policy

If anyone on a call is in the same building as another attendee, do not call individually from a computer station, but instead find a room for everyone in the building meet together.  Programmers spend way too much time behind computer screens.  Meeting in person greatly improves (even encourages) communication, aides in knowledge transfer, and disrupts interruptions of surrounding team members.  White board sessions often come up on the fly and its helpful to have everyone in the same room.  We are team; act like one!

## Dress Professionally

Just because you can come to work wearing a shreded shirt, and pair of jeans with holes in them, and have your underwear showing, does not mean you should.  Dress for the job you want, not the job you have.

# Naming Guides

Following a consistent set of naming conventions in the development of a framework can be a major contribution to the frameworkâ€™s usability. It allows the framework to be used by many developers on widely separated projects. Beyond consistency of form, names of framework elements must be easily understood and must convey the function of each element.

The goal of this section is to provide a consistent set of naming conventions that results in names that make immediate sense to developers.

Although adopting these naming conventions as general code development guidelines would result in more consistent naming throughout your code, you are required only to apply them to APIs that are publicly exposed (public or protected types and members, and explicitly implemented interfaces).

|**COMMENTARY:** Before diving in, please keep in mind that the most important thing about naming is not to be afraid to just pick something and get moving.  Please do not waste hours trying to think of a perfect name.  It is almost always possible to come back later and change a name during the code review process.  With that said, do put a few seconds to a few minutes of thought into any names picked as they may last a while.  Last, please watch the spelling of names as misspellings have a way of lasting years in a system. |
